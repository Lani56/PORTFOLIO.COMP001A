        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I'm 17 and started College right after high school. I'm majoring in IT because it seems interesting. I am new to web development and everything else in IT. I have a twin sister who is two minutes older than me. I love to read books or play video games in my free time. I hope to graduate with a degree in Information Technology. I'm excited to see where taking comp and cis classes take me and I really hope to enjoy them!   </p>
